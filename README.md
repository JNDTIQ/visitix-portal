# VisiTix 

The vision for this site is a modern ticketing platform with a unique take on buying and reselling tickets for any event, Users can come and sign up for the site and if they want to sell tickets on the site, then they have to be verified, which entails uploading a document proving your identity.


## Features
- User authentication with Firebase
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Event browsing and ticket purchasing
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Additionally I wish to implement a key feature that would allow us to gurantee users their money back if they are scammed. Where users if the ticket did not work, they can upload the requisite proof and their money would be refunded.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Technologies
- React
- TypeScript
- Firebase Authentication
- Tailwind CSS
